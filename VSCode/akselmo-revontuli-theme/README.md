# Revontuli theme

Dark and vibrant theme with high contrast.

Note: Sometimes the theme may not want to install because VSCode is weird like that. In that case, add following to the end of large block of
`.vscode/extensions/extensions.json`:

```json
{"identifier":{"id":"akselmo.revontuli-theme"},"version":"5.0.1","location":{"$mid":1,"path":"/home/akseli/.vscode/extensions/akselmo-revontuli-theme","scheme":"file"},"relativeLocation":"akselmo-revontuli-theme"}
```
